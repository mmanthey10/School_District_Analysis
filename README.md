# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

The analysis was performed as a result of alledged academic dishonesty among the ninth grade class at Thomas High School, which would provide inaccurate results for analysis if not removed.

This analysis removes those results to provide accurate analysis of school district metrics, including test scores.
